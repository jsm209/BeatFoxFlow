DESIGN DOC
"Beatfox" is a game that relies on rhythm and timing to defeat enemies and avoid traps.

#################################
# New implementation for traps! #
#################################
Dilemma: Spikes are becoming off time because of either a coding error or 
because of some Unity process... either way there is a surefire solution to try.

Solution: Implement a "beat manager" that every beat, will shoot out a trigger 
to all the objects with a "heartBeat" tag or something. The trigger, probably 
a line that calls a method of the object to "process beat", and the object 
will react accordingly.

--DONE--

# PLAN TO FIX ANIMATIONS #
##########################
Dilemma: The animations keep looping throughout the time the beat is active.
I want the trap to have a startup animation, an active animation, a cooldown animation,
and an idle animation.

Solution: Have the trap play startup animation when isTriggered is true, which has to be
short enough (like 2 frames) that it will quickly lead into the active animation, then when
isTriggered is false, it will leave the active animation into the cooldown animation, which
leads into the idle animation. The idle animation will only proceed to the startup animation
if isTriggered is true again.

# PLANNED MECHANICS #
#####################
- The traps will form a percussion section, which when triggered, will be a sound.
- The chords and melodies will form into stems which can be played randomly and interchangbly for dynamic music.
- The overworld will be a final fantasy type overworld, with random encounters (visably avoidable though, so it's not annoying)
  that result in a quick battle with random enemies on a random arena. The player will earn money this way. Player can flee by running
  off to the side. The player fights by "biting" the enemies.
- There will be a total of 12 levels, 4 per region (northern woods, southern woods, central woods), where upon the completion of 3 levels
  and its respective boss level, will award the player with one of the following abilities (double jump, dash, crawl, but maybe a crawl dash 
  if the player has both...) that allows the player to progress through the game in different paths akin to BOTW.
- The final boss can be accessed at any time by visiting the center of the map, however it will be built in a way that it wil be very hard to
  defeat without the three abilities. This can be achieved with sheer difficulty with a boss rush of the bosses the player hasn't defeated yet.
- Money can be spent on increasing hearts, refilling hearts, and increasing movement speed.
End Goal:
- This game will be finished when it has 12 levels, unlockable abilities, 3 bosses (final boss could just be a boss rush), dynamic music score,
  an overworld, and a shop.
